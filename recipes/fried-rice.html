    <h2>Tasty, easy to make Chinese-style fried rice</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cold</strong> rice - jasmine rice works well or any type of rice you prefer. 
        Cold rice is important as warm rice will not fry well and result in soggy and sticky clumps.</li>
        <li>2-4 eggs</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sesame oil</li>
        <li>A cup of vegetables you like - I like to cook with diced carrots, peas, and other various stir fry veggies such as
        corn, onion and broccoli.</li>
        <li>Any type of oil, vegetable oil or olive oil works well</li>
        <li>Freshly minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a pan or wok, add in your oil and scramble the eggs until done. Break them into small pieces, and transfer
            to a seperate plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Saute your vegetables and garlic until soft and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add in your rice, and then all the other ingredients that we have set aside. Stir to combine, whilst adding in
            the soy sauce and sesame oil until you start to notice the rice and/or vegetables brown slightly.
        </li>
        <li>It is important to taste! Once done, add seasoning according to your taste. Don't be afraid to add extra soy sauce
            or sesame oil if necessary!
        </li>
        <li>Ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
